How To Play
___________



Game Overview

You are in control of an advanced technology known as TOWERS, or TOWERS Operated Without ExteRnal directiveS for short.
These stationary though versatile robots are equipped with a variety of the latest weaponry and resource-harvesting gadgets, though they must connect to the HQ (Root) tower to operate.
Your mission is to eliminate your opponent's HQ from the battlefield.
True to the acronym, the towers aim and attack on their own, allowing you to focus on higher strategy.

Setting Up

1. Log In: Enter your username and password in the top right, then click "Log In." You will not be visible in the lobby until you do so.
2.a. Challenge your Opponent: Click the button with their username on it to challenge them.
  b. Accept a Challenge: If you have been challenged, a widget will appear in the lobby asking you to accept their challenge.
3. Your game will begin shortly.

Gameplay

1. The Game UI is the area above the game view but below the top bar. From left to right:
  a. The Color Patch shows which color you are playing as.
  b. The Info Panel shows your current resources and the name and cost of the tower you have selected to build.
  c. The Tower List shows the different towers you can build and which one you have selected to build (by an orange border). Click to change the build tower type.
  d. The Selection Panel shows the image of the tower you have selected (if any) and the option to salvage it.
 Note that on a small screen you may have to scroll down.

2. The minimap is located in the top left of the game view.
  a. The green rectangle represents the scope of your view of the game. Drag it with the mouse to move your view around the map.
  b. The colored dots represent towers of those colors. Only enemies and unlinked towers visible (see 8) to your linked towers are visible on the minimap.
  c. If the minimap turns yellow, you are under attack. The small black rectangle(s) on the map show the location(s) of attack.

3. The keyboard shortcuts are as follows:
  W/A/S/D or Arrow Keys: Move around the map.
  1-8: Select the nth tower type to build (from left to right).
  Z/C: Cycle (Z: left, C: right) through the tower types to build.
  X: Salvage the selected tower.
  Q: Center the view on your HQ.
  M: Select the Miner to build.
  P: Select the Pylon to build.
  Shift: Activate build/place. A green "preview" will appear under your mouse if the placement is legal, a red preview if illegal.

4. With the mouse:
  a. Click on one of your towers to select it, as will be indicated by a "swinging" green circle around it. With a tower selected:
    i. Click another friendly tower to select it.
    ii. Click an enemy tower to have your tower target it.
    iii. Click the same tower again or on empty space to deselect.
  b. Click with the shift key down (see also 3-Shift) to build a tower of the type selected in the Game UI (see 1) at the location of the click.

5. Footprint:
  a. Towers cannot be placed on top of each other. Each tower has a "footprint" circle which no other tower's may overlap.

6. Resources:
  a. Are present on the map in dark gray circular pools. On the current map the pools contain 576 resources each. In addition, each player begins with 500 resources.
  b. Can be mined by building Miner towers near pools. Gray lines will be drawn from Miners to the pools they are mining from, which will shrink as they are depleted.
  c. Allow you to build towers. If a build is completed, the tower's cost will be deducted from your resource amount.
  d. Can be reclaimed up to 60% from built towers by salvaging them. However, more damaged towers yield fewer resources.

7. Terrain:
  a. Lakes are blue circles or combinations of circles.
  b. Towers cannot be placed on lakes.
  c. A known bug is that the tower build preview indicator (see 3-Shift) is sometimes green even though the tower would be built over a lake.

8. Fog of War:
  a. You can only see things (terrain features, enemies, resource pools, etc.) within a certain range of at least one of your towers.
  b. Unlinked (see 9) towers cannot see.

9. Linkage:
  a. All towers must be linked back through Pylons to your HQ. Otherwise, they will not function (i.e. see, regenerate health, mine, attack).
  b. Towers can only be built within linkage range.
  c. Your Pylons' and HQ's linkage range is represented by the solid, lightly colored circles around them. If these are hard to see, tilt your screen.

10. Attacking and Health:
  a. Attacking towers automatically shoot enemies that are in range. However, you can manually target them (see 4-a-ii).
  b. Attack charge may regenerate at different rates for the same tower. For example, the Pulse Turret fires three bullets in a row, then takes longer to charge up again.
  b. Towers that are linked regerate health over time, some types faster than others.
  c. Health is represented by fraction of green on the rectangular bars above the towers. If the bar is not visible, that tower has full health.
  c. If a tower's health reaches 0, it blows up.

11. Tower stats, as copied from the source code. Numbers are in pixels, rates are per second.
